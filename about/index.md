# Why this blog?
I do most of my blogging for [Payara](http://blog.payara.fish/) now and, before then, [C2B2](http://blog.c2b2.co.uk/). Every so often, I get an idea that just doesn't fit with the work I do for my day job and sharing that [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/croft) just won't cut it. It's particularly a problem when the thing you want to express is an opinion and you really don't want to be misinterpreted.

So that lead me to create this blog. It's a place for opinions, experiments with technology and other tangentially tech-related things. As such, this blog is **entirely** my opinion and therefore does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of any employer of mine, past or present.

# About me
Probably the most accurate way to describe what I do professionally would be to call myself a Java Middleware Consultant, although that doesn't really cover it.

After graduating, I worked for IBM for a bit with WebSphere ESB. After a couple of years and a location change, I found myself working for C2B2. I never really left C2B2, but spent increasing amounts of time working on Payara Server which was launched as a separate initiative, that just happened to be staffed with C2B2 employees.

Since C2B2 is a staunchly independent outfit, it didn't really make sense to be putting this sort of effort in to a competitor of some of the products we worked with. Despite the fact that I would happily recommend whichever application server was most appropriate for the customer I found myself working with, it's hard to prove that you're still independent when your own product is genuinely the most appropriate.

So, on the 6th April 2016, [Payara Services Ltd.](http://www.payara.fish/support) was created and I officially became a Payara employee.

## Work
I currently work for [Payara](https://twitter.com/Payara_Fish) and am very privileged to work with some incredibly talented people. Some of them have an online presence:

 * [Mert Çalışkan](https://twitter.com/mertcal)
 * [Ondrej Mihályi](https://twitter.com/omihalyi)
 * [Lenny Primak](https://twitter.com/lprimak)
 * [Steve Millidge](https://twitter.com/l33tj4v4)

I'm part of the support and services team in Payara so I spend most of my time working directly with customers, remote or on-site, handling support tickets for customers with a support contract or any other ad-hoc work for customers who want to buy consultancy time.

## Personal
I like sport that I can participate in more than sport that I can watch (with the exception of F1 and sometimes rugby). Pretty much any sport where I can compete against myself appeals to me; running, climbing, snowboarding plus lots of other things I haven't got round to yet. (I'll need to buy a Kayak first).
