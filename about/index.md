# Why this blog?
I began writing this blog while working for [Payara Services](https://blog.payara.fish/). Back then, I did most of my blogging for Payara and, before then, [C2B2 Consulting](https://www.c2b2.co.uk/middleware-blog/).

I found that, every so often, I would get an idea that just didn't fit with the work I did for my day job and sharing that [via Twitter](https://twitter.com/croft) just didn't cut it; particularly a problem when the thing you want to express is an opinion and you really don't want to be misinterpreted.

So that lead me to create this blog. It's a place for opinions, experiments with technology and other tangentially tech-related things. As such, this blog is **entirely** my opinion and therefore does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of any employer of mine, past or present.

# About me
Right now, I am a Middleware Consultant for Red Hat.

After graduating, I worked for IBM for a bit with WebSphere ESB. After a couple of years and a location change, I found myself working for C2B2 doing a mix of on-site and remote consulting. I never really left C2B2, but spent increasing amounts of time working on Payara Server (launched as a separate initiative in 2016), that just happened to be staffed with C2B2 employees.

Since C2B2 is a staunchly independent outfit, it didn't really make sense to be putting this sort of effort in to a competitor of some of the products we worked with. Despite the fact that I would happily recommend whichever application server was most appropriate for the customer I found myself working with, it's hard to prove that you're still independent when your own product is genuinely the most appropriate.

So, on the 6th April 2016, [Payara Services Ltd.](https://www.payara.fish/support) was created and I officially became a Payara employee.

After another couple of years building a team I was incredibly proud to be a part of, I felt the time was right to move on. I started at Red Hat in the middle of 2018.

# Work
I currently work for [Red Hat](https://developers.redhat.com/) and haven't been there long so I'm still carving out my place in the team. I'm still trying to keep involved with [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io), although I'll be using Thorntail now rather than Payara Micro.

# Personal
I like sport that I can participate in more than sport that I can watch (with the exception of F1 and sometimes rugby). Pretty much any sport where I can compete against myself appeals to me; running, climbing, snowboarding plus lots of other things I haven't got round to yet. (I'll need to buy a Kayak first).
