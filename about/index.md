# About me
Probably the most accurate way to describe what I do professionally would be to call myself a Java Middleware Consultant, although that doesn't really cover it.

After graduating, I started work for IBM, after having interned for them as an undergraduate, working with WebSphere ESB. I spent some time with the performance team before moving to the level 3 support team for the rest of my time there.

Since then, I joined C2B2 and have broadened my technical horizons since we partner with just about everyone in Java middleware who isn't IBM. (I'm working on changing that. I still miss the diagnostics you get out of the IBM J9 JVM)

## Work
I work for C2B2

## Personal
I like sport that I can participate in more than sport that I can watch (with the exception of F1). Pretty much any sport where I can compete against myself appeals to me; running, climbing, snowboarding plus lots of other things I haven't got round to yet. (I'll need to buy a Kayak first).
