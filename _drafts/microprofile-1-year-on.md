As I write this blog post, on Tuesday 27th June 2017, I'm looking through memories of where I was on this day in 2016: San Francisco.

It was a Monday and, still reeling from the shock of a certain small vote, I joined Tomitribe's Theresa Nguyen, IBM's Alasdair Nottingham, the London Java Community's Martijn Verburg and Red Hat's Mark Little, as we announced a joint venture in MicroProfile.io.

Since then...

* MP 1.0 announced at JavaOne
* Joined Eclipse, lots of growing pains
* New specs created
* New members joined (Hazelcast, Fujitsu, KumuluzEE, Smartbear, OpenTracing)
* LOTS of discussion
* LOTS of work
* [Hard work is not always obvious](https://twitter.com/katharineCodes/status/879302449152098304)

Where are we now?

* Settled into Eclipse Foundation, familiar with processes
* 1.1 is delayed but imminent
* 1.2 and 2.0 are planned
* Several of our own specs are in progress, some complete or near complete
* Additional externally developed specs are being considered

Where are we heading?

* Pace is increasing
* More clarity on how to get things done
* A sandbox approach vs proposal approach
* A fresh new logo/branding
* An expanded Website
* A strong 2018!
* Lots of conferences!
