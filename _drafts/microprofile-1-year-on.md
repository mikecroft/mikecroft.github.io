As I write this blog post, on Tuesday 27th June 2017, I'm looking through memories of where I was on this day in 2016: San Francisco.

It was a Monday and, still reeling from the shock of a certain small vote, I joined Tomitribe's Theresa Nguyen, IBM's Alasdair Nottingham, the London Java Community's Martijn Verburg and Red Hat's Mark Little, as we announced a joint venture in MicroProfile.io.

In the last year, we've come a long way as a community. Here are a few highlights...

## How did we get here?
By JavaOne in September of 2016 there were implementations of MicroProfile from Red Hat, IBM, Payara and Tomitribe, and I was even able to use Payara's Microprofile edition in my JavaOne tutorial! By Devoxx Belgium in November, I was able to stand on stage with Alasdair, Heiko, David and Andy to demonstrate our collaborative conference app; a separate microservice written by each vendor plus a simple frontend to show it all off.

It was around that time that work to bring the MicroProfile under the Eclipse Foundation began. From a very early stage, it was clear that a foundation would be needed to "own" the IP so that any community contributions would be protected. Eclipse was chosen and, in the months that followed around Christmas, a huge amount of behind-the-scenes work went on to make sure we were fully compliant and understoood everything that we needed to do as Eclipse Foundation members.

Since then...

* MP 1.0 announced at JavaOne
* Joined Eclipse, lots of growing pains
* New specs created
* New members joined (Hazelcast, Fujitsu, KumuluzEE, Smartbear, OpenTracing)
* LOTS of discussion
* LOTS of work
* [Hard work is not always obvious](https://twitter.com/katharineCodes/status/879302449152098304)


## Where are we now?
Due in no small part to all the efforts to move to the Eclipse Foundation, there were inevitable delays to work on the next version of MicroProfile. Fortunately, the community was very dedicated and work on new specs is now progressing at a very healthy pace!

The current list of proposals being actively worked on after a year is:

* Config
* Fault Tolerance
* JWT Role Based Access Control
* Health Checks
* Metrics/Telemetry
* Standardised properties

There are even a couple of existing APIs being reviewed for inclusion:

* Distributed Tracing (based on [opentracing.io](http://opentracing.io/))
* Standardised REST API documentation (based on OpenAPI/Swagger)

In spite of the delays caused by moving to the Eclipse Foundation (and, really, just learning to work together efficiently) we are now in a position to release MicroProfile 1.1, which includes version 1.0 of the Config API, once final IP checks are complete. We also have dates and plans for versions 1.2 and 2.0, though the specs to be included in those versions is yet to be finalised. (Join the discussion!)

Eclipse MicroProfile is also much stronger than it was a year ago. There was an expected large buzz at the beginning of the project as blogs were written and waves were made through the TwitterSphere but since then, we've been very pleased to welcome new corporate members of Eclipse Microprofile, proudly shown off on the front page of microprofile.io:

* Hazelcast
* Fujitsu
* KumuluzEE
* Smartbear

All of the work that's been done and all of the activity that's still continuing gives us a very strong starting point to take us forward through the second half of 2017 and into 2018...

## Where are we heading?
Anecdotally, it seems that the pace of change is picking up. The MicroProfile effort has been quite grand in ambition right from the start, with many contributors across the world with differing amounts of other commitments. Bringing together such a diverse range of people has been tricky, at times, but the benefits of such an approach are really coming to fruition.

The specifications being developed specifically for MicroProfile are progressing more quickly now that many initial questions have been answered for other projects so, although Config 1.0 was the only additional spec to make it to MicroProfile 1.1, I am quietly confident that Fault Tolerance, Health Checks and JWT security will be done and usable shortly afterwards.

The technical side of the project is not the only side that has been putting in a lot of effort. Marketing specialists from all originally participating companies are coming together to discuss branding and a revamped logo for the project that can be truly community-driven. Tomitribe, who have generously provided hosting for the MicroProfile website over the past year, are putting a lot of effort into improving the site and helping to document the current projects.

* Pace is increasing
* More clarity on how to get things done
* A sandbox approach vs proposal approach
* A fresh new logo/branding
* An expanded Website
* A strong 2018!
* Lots of conferences!
