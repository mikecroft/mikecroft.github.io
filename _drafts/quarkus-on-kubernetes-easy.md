I've been using Quarkus a lot lately. Not because I particularly need to; I just enjoy using it so much that I've found myself looking for ways to shoehorn it in to whatever it is I'm doing at the time.

> *Oh, what's that? You want a demonstration of CI/CD in OpenShift? Let me just create a new Quarkus project first...*

I think the thing that keeps bringing me back to Quarkus is how often I find new features that have been added to *make my life easier*.
