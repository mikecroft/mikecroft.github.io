I've been using Quarkus a lot lately. Not because I particularly need to; I just enjoy using it so much that I've found myself looking for ways to shoehorn it in to whatever it is I'm doing at the time.

> *Oh, what's that? You want a demonstration of CI/CD in OpenShift? Let me just create a new Quarkus project first...*

I think the thing that keeps bringing me back to Quarkus is how often I find new features that have been added to *make my life easier*. One of the features that I've found most useful and time-saving is [the Kubernetes extension](https://quarkus.io/guides/kubernetes).

A really common complaint from people who are new to Kubernetes is the significant complexity and large number of new concepts to learn. Also, [there's the YAML](https://noyaml.com/).
