From time to time, I speak at some conferences. It's always an interesting experience because I never know how they are going to go. Some that I think have been rubbish get a great reception, then other times when I think I've done well, seem to have a bit of a cool response. I always get good feedback from people afterwards, though, which I really appreciate.

## JavaOne, San Francisco
*[Cloud-Native Java EE [TUT3633]](https://oracle.rainfocus.com/scripts/catalog/oow16.jsp?event=javaone&search=TUT3633&search.event=javaone)*  
Despite sharing the name with a talk I've already done, this is a new talk. It builds on the concepts I've already presented but, as a tutorial, will be much more demo-heavy.

## JEEConf, Kiev
*[Cloud Native Java EE](http://jeeconf.com/program/cloud-native-java-ee/)*  
The key aim of this talk was to show that modern Enterprise Java is already ready for elastic, dynamically scalable deployments. It was the first outing for this talk, and I wasn't particularly happy with my delivery although I think the talk itself is good! The link above has a video of me which I haven't watched yet (I hate watching videos of myself back)

## JAX Finance, London
*[Java EE Microservice platforms - which is best?](https://finance.jaxlondon.com/session/java-ee-microservice-platforms-which-is-best/)*  
This was an investigation into the differing approaches taken by Spring Boot, WildFly Swarm and Payara Micro. It was an odd talk - orginially concieved when I was an *independent* C2B2 consultant, but didn't make it to be accepted as a talk before I moved to work for Payara. So the independence went out the window. Then, the first talk that got accepted was to JDays on a date that I was going to be snowboarding in France! Steve, my boss, ended up being lumbered with a talk I hadn't written yet and that he couldn't be independent about either (sorry Steve!). He wrote a great talk, though, and I got to present it at JAX.
