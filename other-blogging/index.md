Since most of my blogging now is done for Payara, and before that C2B2, I thought I would maintain a list of links to those blogs I have written elsewhere. I'll also try to include links to posts and interviews which have been published on other blogs too, where I can.

I have marked blogs that I think are still relevant or interesting in bold below.

# C2B2 Blogs
These blogs were (almost) all published before I transferred to Payara. At that time, I worked with lots of Java middleware, hence the wide range. There may be one or two formatting issues, since the blogging platform was upgraded and not every blog converted properly.
